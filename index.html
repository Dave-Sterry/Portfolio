        <h2 class="card-title"> About Me</h2>
        <p class="card-text"> <img src="family.jpg" alt="a photo of my wife, our dog and I">A long time Oregonian, I currently live in NE Portland with my wife Jean and our <span class=hightlight>adorable</span> dog Helo. A long time runner, mountain biker, climber, and recovering cycle-cross racer I try to spend as much of my free time outside as I can. If I’m not inside watching movies, playing videos games or practicing guitar, you’ll probably find me outside on an adventure, or just wandering around my neighborhood with Jean and Helo.</p>

        <h2 class="card-title"> Background</h2>  
        <p class=card-text">Originally from the East Coast I moved to Portland with my family when I was 10 years old. Hard to believe that was 27 years ago now! After high school I went to Southern Oregon University and got a BS in Sociology. A year after I finished my degree I went to teach English in Japan for a year in the medium sized town of Saijo. Even though my Japanese language skills were mediocre at best, I still had a wonderful experience. After returning to Portland in late 2007, I got a job at a small law firm as an office assistant. After 4 years in that position I was promoted to IT manager for the firm. This mostly meant I did onsite desktop support for all the staff, but I learned quite a bit extra with the help of our IT consultant firm while in the position. After staying in that position for 6 years I decided it was time to move on and try something new, and left in late 2018 to pursue a career in Physical Therapy. I spent a year and a half taking general science classes at PCC in preparation to apply to a PT grad program. However once COVID hit the US it became near impossible to get the required observation hours I needed to apply to the program. So I turned to another career path that had interested me for years. Programming. </p>

        <h2 class="card=title">Why Programming?</h2>
        <p class="card-text"></p>So why programming? The simplest answer is that I like to understand how things work, and then use that knowledge to build something and since I was young I’ve loved messing around on computers. I’m old enough to remember having to launch all my PC games out of the command line, something that felt like <em>magic</em> when I was 10.  The more complicated answer is that I also recognize that this is a very in demand skill set, and is only becoming more so. And while I may have many interests outside of coding, I know learning to program will let me pursue a career at many different companies. Ideally one that makes or supports one of my interests.</p>
